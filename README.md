## The simple pin extractor from poems
The pin extractor uses poems to create generic pin codes using the word length of each word in a poem.

This project was built during my python cartification course. The simple pin extractor uses multiple common functions, like split()
enumerate(), len(), str(), += string concatenation, [] list creation, append(), """ multi line strings, and return. This project teaches the following:
* string splitting
* line by line process
* index_based access
* conditional logic
* function strucutre
* basic algorithm design


## How it works in steps:
1. Splits each poem into lines.
2. Splits each line into words.
3. If the word at the current line exists -> add the length of that word to the pin.
4. Else, it should add '0'.
5. Repeat for all poems to return the secret code or other words, the pin.
